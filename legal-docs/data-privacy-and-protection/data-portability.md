# Data portability&#x20;

The right to data portability is regulated by the GDPR under [Article 20](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-20-gdpr/). In short, it states that data subjects have the right to receive personal data concerning them in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and have the right to transmit these data to another party if the situations described under its number one are fulfilled, including by having the right to have the personal data transmitted directly from one to another, where technically possible. Provisions with a similar effect can also be found under e.g. CCPA.

Within the idOS, Users can easily retrieve their data via their [User Data Dashboard](../../how-it-works/functionality/user-data-dashboard.md) by sending a wallet signature, whilst via Access Grants they can share it with requesting third parties, resulting that users can access their data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format, via the User Data Dashboard. The idOS [roadmap](../../how-it-works/product-roadmap.md) also includes a download functionality to be embedded in the User Data Dashboard.

The dStorage Network of Nodes doesn't compromise the ability to port data, and in fact, it may enhance security while still allowing for data portability. Users can also easily reuse verified credentials across different platforms, aligning with the spirit of data protection laws when it comes to data portability requirements.
