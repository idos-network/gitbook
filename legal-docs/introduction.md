# Introduction

As the identity layer of web3, one of the idOS' main objectives is to ensure that users across the web3 space can confidently manage and share their identities in a decentralized environment. It is part of its mission to provide an open-source, chain-agnostic solution that not only serves as the foundation for decentralized identity but also contributes to this foundation being built on the bedrock of compliance.

Identity is more than just a digital representation of oneself. It's a gateway to countless interactions, transactions, and experiences in the web3 ecosystem. This understanding comes along with the goal of fostering an environment where interactions are secure, private, and compliant with global standards.

While built upon principles of decentralization, self-sovereignty, and chain-agnosticism, idOS also takes into account the importance of adhering to international regulations and industry best practices, including in the areas of data privacy, protection, and data anti-money laundering. It is not just about adhering to rules but also about building trust in the web3 community, helping users navigate the digital realm with confidence, and providing a protocol for dApps and other web3 entities to build upon.

The idOS aims to put user privacy first from an early stage. It is designed with clear parameters that dictate when and how data can be shared with third parties, ensuring all sharing is in line with user permissions.

In an era where data sovereignty has such an emphasis, the idOS allows for data processing locations to be compliant with international regulations. In parallel, the idOS' system was architected to ensure that on-chain data doesn't compromise user identity, fostering a balance between transparency and privacy. And at the heart of idOS also lies the empowerment of users: its embedded mechanisms allow users to exercise data deletion, portability, and rectification.

Since collaborations are key in the decentralized space, the idOS framework outlines the roles and responsibilities of third parties, be they identity verification providers, node providers, or dApps. At the same time, its data-sharing mechanisms help obligated entities leverage the idOS while staying compliant with their specific regulatory requirements.&#x20;

The idOS recognizes the role of identity providers that function as issuers, ensuring a seamless identity verification process while acknowledging the diverse needs of the web3 space: Its framework allows for the integration of various KYC providers as data verification providers, offering flexibility and choice. It also does not forget about the importance of the possibility of retaining data for legal or regulatory reasons, as the idOS provides mechanisms for compliance with data retention obligations without compromising user rights.&#x20;

In such a context, the idOS legal framework is a structure that aims to address the multifaceted legal challenges of the decentralized web, as further explored in the sections below.&#x20;
