# Legal Considerations

Ensuring transparency and establishing a valid legal basis for data processing is generally essential for complying with data protection laws such as GDPR or other privacy frameworks.

idOS provides flexible tools and interfaces designed to facilitate secure data storage and exchange while allowing integrators to adapt and customize their user-facing communication in accordance with their specific compliance needs. Compliance with legal and regulatory requirements remains the sole responsibility of the integrating party. We built idOS with flexibility in mind, allowing integrating parties to retain control over how they meet their own regulatory requirements.&#x20;

When integrating as an Issuer or Consumer within idOS, you have the ability, for example, to tailor the way you communicate your legal basis for processing personal data to align with your regulatory obligations. Before processing an end user's (idOS Data Owner) personal data through idOS components (such as SDKs or the idOS Isle)— such as when requesting a Write or Access grant—integrators are responsible for presenting all necessary mandated information as per applicable data protection frameworks in a clear and accessible way, including but not limited to:

* The purpose of the personal data processing.
* The legal basis for the personal data processing.

Additionally, wallet signatures within idOS include an idOS' Terms & Conditions package which is a mandatory step that must not be obfuscated, bypassed, or removed by any integrating party. This step is an essential part of the user flow and must remain clearly visible and accessible.

_This document is for informational purposes only and does not constitute legal advice. idOS provides tools for secure data storage and exchange but does not ensure compliance with legal or regulatory requirements. Integrating entities are solely responsible for determining their legal obligations and ensuring compliance. We strongly recommend consulting legal professionals before using idOS. idOS disclaims any liability for non-compliance arising from the use of its components, SDKs, or infrastructure. By integrating with idOS, you accept full responsibility for meeting all legal requirements applicable to you._
