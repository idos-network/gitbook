## Introducing the idOS Consortium

The idOS Consortium brings together leading ecosystems and projects ([Arbitrum](https://arbitrum.io/), [Circle](https://www.circle.com/en/), [Ripple](https://ripple.com/), [NEAR](https://near.org/), [Starknet](https://www.starknet.io/), [Horizen Labs](https://horizenlabs.io/), [Tezos](https://tezos.com/), [Radix](https://www.radixdlt.com/), [Aleph Zero](https://alephzero.org/) and [PartisiaBlockchain](https://partisiablockchain.com/)). We are building idOS as a collaborative, open-source effort. Building the decentralized identity layer of the internet is a challenge that requires the support of multiple leading organizations in the space, contrary to building closed standalone standards.&#x20;

**The idOS Consortium is not just marketing optics**. Consortium members are **directly engaged in idOS' governance** (both in the idOS Association General Assembly as well as the Governance Committee) and have direct impact on how idOS is built. **idOS Consortium members directly contributed in the** [**Consortium Round**](https://x.com/idOS_network/status/1810584640098304416) **of idOS at its seed stage**.

**The idOS Consortium meets on a monthly basis to discuss progress and align efforts**. By collaborating across multiple ecosystems, the idOS Consortium is building the foundation for a decentralized identity storage network that prioritizes security, usability, and adoption. By pooling expertise, resources, and innovation, the Consortium focuses on addressing three main areas for the projects development: Product, Growth, and Compliance.

* **Product:** dedicated to developing and refining idOS's core product and network functionalities, from data storage and security to compliant access management. It ensures these components are scalable and user-friendly while supporting broader ecosystem needs like interoperability with OpenFi tools and services.
* **Growth**: focuses on expanding awareness and adoption of idOS as the identity layer of the internet. Through joint initiatives, publications, and events, the Consortium positions idOS as a trusted and essential component across web3.
* **Compliance:** idOS is committed to becomes a usable solution to store and manage access to data, in line with data handling, financial and AML regulations across the world. This includes addressing challenges in data storage and deletion, KYC reusability, and jurisdiction-specific needs to build a truly compliant identity framework that can scale globally.

idOS Consortium members will be the first node operators upon the idOS' Storage Network launch.
