# System architecture

idOS is composed of a **dStorage Network of Nodes**, secured by the [building partners](../../overview/the-idos-consortium.md) as the [initial node providers](../progressive-decentralization.md), and designed specifically to manage identity data compliance and security needs, and an **Access Management Protocol**, giving self-sovereign control to users of their own data, and allowing them to interact with dApps across the whole web3 space. Additionally, idOS provides an [**SDK for dApps**](../../developer-docs/dapp-sdk-integration.md) to integrate idOS and a [**User Data Dashboard**](../functionality/user-data-dashboard.md), where users can manage their stored data, credentials, and access grants.&#x20;
