# Tools

## Software Development Kit (SDK)

The idOS JavaScript SDK enables dApp frontends to easily work with the idOS. It supports the most common use cases, such as requesting data and access grants from the user. You can find the SDK source [on GitHub](https://github.com/idos-network/idos-sdk-js/tree/main/packages/idos-sdk-js).

## Command Line Interface (CLI)

The idOS command-line tool empowers developers with a convenient interface to the idOS, and can be easily integrated by the backend of any dapp. We are loooking to release it later this year.

## User Data Dashboard

The [User Data Dashboard](functionality/user-data-dashboard.md) is a reference implementation of a user-facing idOS data management application. The User Data Dashboard is meant to be forked, improved and individualized by dApps and other parties utilizing the idOS. You can find the data dashboard source [on GitHub](https://github.com/idos-network/idos-sdk-js/tree/main/apps/idos-data-dashboard).
