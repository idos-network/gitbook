# User Data Dashboard

The [User Data Dashboard](https://dashboard.idos.network/) is one of the tools to allow users to manage their data with the idOS. It is an open-source dApp built on top of the idOS. It is meant to be a resource for teams that want to build their own versions, and individualize their visuals and functionalities.&#x20;

The main functionalities of the User Data Dashboard are:

* Manage [data](../../overview/what-data-how-is-it-stored.md) that has been stored in the user's idOS profile (edit, delete)
* Manage admin addresses&#x20;
* Manage [access grants](granting-data-access.md) (create new ones, revoke old ones, see time locks)
* Directing users to [data verification providers](../system-architecture/roles-main-stakeholders.md#issuers) to receive verified credentials&#x20;

The demo of the User Data Dashboard will be released shortly.
