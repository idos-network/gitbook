# Compliant dStorage

Compliant, decentralized storage to store identity information is one of the two pillars of the idOS. dStorage allows users to maintain self-sovereignty and privacy while gaining the convenience of cloud storage. dStorage isn't a new concept to web3, but foremost compliance concerns have kept it from gaining widespread adoption for personal data. dStorage has clear advantages over identity wallets in terms of data availability and composability.&#x20;

## Tackling the compliance challenge

Compliance with data protection laws has been a major issue for the mainstream adoption of decentralized storage for user data. Data protection regulations that promote users' right to be forgotten have been contradictory to permanent storage and P2P node systems. The idOS is a [Network of Nodes](../system-architecture/decentralized-storage/) that runs a protocol enforcing a [state consensus](../system-architecture/decentralized-storage/#consensus) of data between nodes, which in turn assures that data deletions by the user get propagated throughout the network.&#x20;
