# Standard identity formats

The idOS encourages identity verification providers to issue credentials that follow the [W3C Verifiable Credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) standard, as it's the most commonly accepted VC standard today, and our SDK is prepared to work with it. For more information check the [W3C Verifiable Credentials](../system-architecture/decentralized-storage/w3c-verifiable-credentials.md) section.
