# Progressive decentralization

We see decentralization as an ethos and an ongoing journey, rather than a binary state. The building partners are committed to [progressively decentralize](https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/progressive-decentralization-a-high-level-framework/) idOS as much as possible, while making sure we don't rush important decisions that could hurt its success.

Details are coming soon!

Note: While idOS doesn't store any data centrally, identity verification providers may store certain data privately (e.g. to avoid duplicates or for specific compliance reasons). Please check with each identity verification provider what information they are storing. More details can be found [here](../overview/what-data-how-is-it-stored.md#identity-verification-providers-data-handling).
