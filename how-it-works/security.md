# Security

Security in idOS is essential, and we are taking a pragmatic approach to hardening the security posture of the components of the idOS system in order of priority. At the beginning, idOS Storage Network Operators will have to pass a manual KYB process run by the idOS Association. \
\
As user data is encrypted with the user's private key, even a leak of an operator's copy of the idOS database would not expose user data in plaintext.

We have completed several audits for different parts of the idOS Storage and Economy networks, as well as specific smart contracts.\
\
**Audit reports:**

* [IDOS Token, Vesting & Staking smart contracts](https://github.com/idos-network/contracts/blob/master/NM0731-FINAL_IDOS.pdf) ([Nethermind](https://www.nethermind.io/))
* [idOS Enclave audit](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22494008/Audit_Report_IDOS-ENC_FINAL_1.1.pdf) ([Resonance](https://resonance.security))
* [idOS Community Sale smart contract audit](https://github.com/idos-network/idos-sale/blob/audit/idOS%20Community%20Sale%20Smart%20Contract%20Audit_Subvisual.pdf) [(Subvisual](https://subvisual.com/)) <br>

As we progress and take the decentralization training wheels off, we will have other components of the idOS protocol audited. We will also update here with more information on our bug bounty program.&#x20;

You can find more about our security and privacy posture in our "[idOS Security and Privacy](http://www.idos.network/blog/idos-security-privacy)" article and a [video](https://youtu.be/YKgAVPilsmQ) from our cofounder Julio Santos on the topic.&#x20;
