## IDOS Token

<details>

<summary>‘Wen Token?’</summary>

The IDOS Token Launch will take place on March 5, 2026 after the Uniswap CCA sale. More details: [https://x.com/idOS\_network/status/2019410778877546909](https://x.com/idOS_network/status/2019410778877546909)

<details>

<summary>What are the main use cases of the IDOS Token?</summary>

IDOS is a utility token. Its main role is to secure the idOS Storage Network, and distribute gas fees across its key actors. Node Operators need to stake a minimum amount of IDOS to join the network, and Data Issuers and Consumers incur gas fees from performing write and read operations. Token holders will also be able to delegate their tokens to a Node Operator to participate in the network's security.

<details>

<summary>Are there any geographies or jurisdictions not eligible to participate in the app?</summary>

For regulatory reasons, citizens and residents of countries in the [FATF](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/countries/black-and-grey-lists.html) and [EU High Risk Countries List](https://finance.ec.europa.eu/financial-crime/anti-money-laundering-and-countering-financing-terrorism-international-level_en) are not eligible to participate in app.idos.network and related campaigns.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Why can’t I access <a href="http://app.idos.network/">app.idos.network</a> through my phone?</summary>

idOS works across devices, but wallet connections for web apps are limited on mobile. For the smoothest experience, please use a desktop browser that supports wallet extensions (e.g. Chrome, Brave, Firefox).

</details>

<details>

<summary>What are points and how do I earn them in the idOS App?</summary>

Users can earn points from completing quests such as joining idOS’s socials and referring a friend to the app. Points are a sign of the engagement of a user with idOS, and show the user’s loyalty to the project. Stay tuned, as more quests will progressively appear in the app. Points are kept off-chain, are not transferable, have no monetary value, cannot be traded or exchanged, and confer no rights ([terms](https://www.idos.network/legal/user-agreement) apply)

</details>

<details>

<summary>How are idOS App points and Wallchain Mindshare related?</summary>

idOS App points and Wallchain Mindshare are separate engagement metrics. Users can be eligible for both idOS App points and Wallchain Mindshare for conducting different activities.\
\
Mindshare is a social engagement metric only, controlled and operated by Wallchain (third-party terms may apply). The programs may change and/or be discontinued. You are not eligible if you are a citizen, resident of, or located in a Restricted Jurisdiction (as defined under the [Terms](https://www.idos.network/legal/user-agreement)) or if in your jurisdiction such programs would be illegal.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How can I be eligible for IDOS Airdrops?</summary>

Users that take part in idOS’ incentive campaigns may be eligible to participate in IDOS airdrops. Participation in IDOS airdrops will be assessed prior to TGE, and potential token distributions may occur shortly after TGE.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Who has access to my data and credentials in the idOS Profile?</summary>

By default, only you. Data inside credentials in idOS is encrypted with your key pair. Only people to whom you have given an Access Grant are able to see the data inside a credential. You can manage your data and revoke access to a credential by clicking the 3 dots next to a credential in your profile. For more information on what and how your data is stored in idOS, check [#data-privacy-and-security](../how-it-works/faqs-users.md#data-privacy-and-security "mention").

</details>

<details>

<summary>What is a Proof-of-Personhood (PoP) credential and what data is stored inside?</summary>

To verify that each individual in the idOS App is a unique human, we are conducting a Proof-of-Personhood check. Our biometrics solution generates a FaceVector, a unique, non-reversible string of numbers derived from your face, that does not contain any images or biometric information. All computations and processing happen in a secure enclave, and pictures of your face are never shown to third parties or stored anywhere in the system. The PoP credential includes your unique, anonymized idOS biometric ID, but no actual biometric information of yours. For more information, please check [biometrics-and-idos-facesign-beta.md](../how-it-works/biometrics-and-idos-facesign-beta.md "mention").

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can I have multiple idOS Profiles?</summary>

To avoid bots and incentive farming, in the idOS App users are limited to creating only one idOS Profile. At the protocol level, users may create multiple profiles, using different wallets, and can later prove they belong to the same person if needed.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Why does my idOS FaceSign PoP check keep failing?</summary>

The FaceSign check may be failing because of two main reasons:\
\
1\) You have already successfully completed a FaceSign PoP check in the idOS App, and have an idOS profile (please log in with a wallet connected to your idOS Profile)\
2\) Your face is covered (e.g. hat, glasses), there is low lighting, or your device camera has a low resolution. For better results, we recommend completing the idOS FaceSign journey on mobile, by scanning the QR code in the web app screen.\
\
Please bear in mind that for security anti-spoofing idOS FaceSign does not work if you are screen-sharing or sharing your video with another app or on a call.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Why do I need to connect a primary EVM wallet to my idOS Profile?</summary>

An EVM wallet is necessary to receive IDOS tokens. Keep your wallet safe; we cannot recover private keys or change the wallet where you will receive your tokens, but you will be able to switch your primary EVM wallet at any time.
