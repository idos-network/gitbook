## Introducing the IDOS Token: Allocation & Distribution

\
**IDOS** is the utility token of idOS: the decentralized identity network enabling identity portability for the stablecoin economy.

\
IDOS is an **ERC-20** token, first deployed on **Arbitrum One**. The token has a **fixed total supply of 1,000,000,000** (1 billion) tokens.

\
As we approach the Token Distribution Event (**TDE**, expected Q4 2025), here’s a transparent look at how the IDOS token supply will be allocated, vested, and released over time.\
‍

### &#x20;Allocation Overview

\
The IDOS Token allocation is designed to keep the majority of the supply focused on ecosystem growth, security through staking, and community participation over the coming decade.

### Optimizing for Community Distribution, Transparency and Alignment

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

We designed IDOS to have utility from day one. To achieve that, we are releasing more than 1/3rd of the total token supply on TDE, and allocating a large portion of it to our community, to encourage early usage and contribution. **41.3% of the total IDOS supply is planned to be distributed to the community.**\
**‍**

The IDOS token exists to align incentives between **users, builders, integrators, and infrastructure partners** who share the vision of an open, interoperable identity system. Every allocation, vesting schedule, and emission stage has been designed to keep the **ecosystem sustainable and community-oriented for the next decade**.\
‍

**5-year Token Distribution Schedule**\
**‍**Please notice the Staking Rewards bucket goes beyond the 5-year schedule

\
**Staking Rewards**

Staking is the main mechanism for idOS to bootstrap participation and network security. A total of **150 million IDOS (15% of total supply)** is allocated to staking rewards, planned to be distributed across **10 years** in a staged emission schedule that balances early participation with long-term sustainability:\
‍

* Years 1-2: 30 million IDOS per year (20% of Staking rewards pool/year)
* Years 3-6: 15 million IDOS per year (10% of Staking rewards pool/year)
* Years 7-10: 7.5 million IDOS per year (5% of Staking rewards pool/year)\
  ‍

Over time, staking rewards are expected to be complemented by sustainable fees accruing to  the idOS Association from Access Grants. These fees are intended to be used for token buy-backs and to provide additional incentives for securing the idOS network.\
‍

Rewards will accrue daily and can be claimed at any time.
