# Market focus

Because of its open-source and permissionless nature, only the community can decide what idOS will be used for. In principle, idOS can be used to store any type of data. However, to foster adoption and usage, the idOS Association core team has prioritized a clear go-to-market focus and use cases for the near term, around KYC re-usability for OpenFi.

#### Key focus today: KYC Re-usability for Stablecoin apps (neobanks, financial modules)

The concept of decentralized identity has been around since projects like Ethereum came live in 2014, yet many companies attempting to bring it to life have not succeeded. We believe the 'solving decentralized identity' is too broad of a challenge, and teams should focus on addressing specific needs and collaborating together. For this reason, idOS today is specifically focusing on one critical market: **KYC re-usability for Stablecoin apps**. With idOS, users can verify their identity once and use it across multiple applications and ecosystems, ensuring compliance and efficiency.

#### The Stablecoin Economy: What It Is and What's the Potential

The Stablecoin Economy (AKA OpenFi, Embedded finance, PayFi, etc.) can be summarized as ['Composable Money for Everyday Use'](https://youtu.be/RVe5H5OqVcw?si=Z9-RyvYO8R1V-abs). It represents the natural evolution of DeFi into a composable, inclusive, and user-centric financial system for real-world use cases. Unlike legacy financial systems that are monolithic and closed, Stablecoin applications collaborate on a composable way to build better products faster, and put the user in control of their funds and their data. Stablecoin apps include neobanks, onramp/payments solutions, self-custodial debit cards and bank accounts, lending solutions, and more.

The potential of Stablecoin apps lies in its ability to lower transaction costs for users - up to 10x compared to traditional systems - while enabling faster and cheaper innovation cycles for builders (composability = lower capex, opex and permissionless innovation) and increasing financial inclusion across the world. Stablecoin apps provide programmable financial tools that empower developers, businesses, and users to create and interact with financial solutions seamlessly. With its focus on bridging crypto and fiat systems, Stablecoin appsares set to bring blockchain technology to mainstream adoption.

#### Example Use Cases

While there are many relevant use cases within Stablecoin apps, idOS is mainly focusing on enabling 3 specific use cases (see more details in the [Example use cases](example-use-cases/) section).\
\
1\. A stablecoin neobank or wallet integration, acting as a front-end for users to interact with multiple OpenFi financial modules (e.g. self-custodial bank account, debit card, etc.) provided by different obliged entities\
\
2\. A direct integration with a stablecoin financial module provider (e.g. self-custodial bank account, debit card, fiat on/off-ramp etc.), leveraging their existing verified users and connecting directly with their identity verification provider APIs\
\
3\. A 'web2-to-web3' integration (e.g. a CEX, fintech, institution) to bring their already verified users on-chain, allowing them to own their data and re-share it across web3 apps.

#### Why idOS is at the Core of the Stablecoin economy

idOS is core infrastructure for stablecoin apps. idOS serves as the backbone of the stablecoin economy by enabling identity data reusability and orchestration, seamless user onboarding and compliance by extending the composable nature of DeFi to real world use cases. In the TradFi world, companies have built monolithic systems providing multiple (licensed services) under a single entity umbrella. While this approach is slow and requires a high initial investment (i.e. obtaining country-specific licenses for each service offered), it only requires user to verify their data once, to use all services.

#### Our first product: Seamless onboarding and KYC orchestration for stablecoin neobanks

Stablecoin applications are and will keep disrupting traditional (financial) systems, but they must offer a degree of user experience that is similar or better that centralized solutions. Asking users to verify their data with different providers to use different services under the same front-end is not an acceptable option for users. idOS acts as the "glue" that connects various applications allowing users to navigate the use and reshare their data across multiple integrated services seamlessly - from payments to lending to governance - without the need for repeated verifications.

Our first solution, built on top of idOS, enables stablecoin neobanks to offer end-to-end decentralized user onboarding and data management, without compromising on UX, compliance or security.
