# Case studies for KYC re-usability

KYC reusability is not a concept invented by idOS—it is rooted in international regulatory frameworks and best practices.  idOS aims to align with these global standards and streamline KYC Re-usability between financial institutions and other entities in a secure and compliant manner. Below are some real-world initiatives that illustrate the growing trend toward KYC Re-usability.

### **European Union Digital Identity Wallet (EUDI Wallet)**

The [**European Digital Identity Wallet (EUDI Wallet)**](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/display/EUDIGITALIDENTITYWALLET/EU+Digital+Identity+Wallet+Home) is an initiative of the European Commission that enables EU citizens and residents to store, manage, and reuse their verified personal identity data across borders. As part of the [**eIDAS 2.0 Regulation**](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/eidas-regulation), the EUDI Wallet aims to provide a unified, interoperable digital identity framework for the EU.

#### **How Reusability Works**

* The Wallet allows individuals to store verified credentials issued by government agencies, financial institutions, and other trusted entities.
* These credentials can be reused across multiple services (e.g., opening a bank account, accessing government portals, signing contracts) without requiring repeated identity verification.
* Institutions relying on credentials can verify authenticity in real time, reducing compliance burdens and fraud risks.

#### **Implementation**

* Set to be implemented by 2026 across EU member states.
* The European Commission has proposed a common technical architecture to ensure interoperability.
* Various pilot projects have been launched across the EU to test implementation in real-world scenarios.

### **QuarkID (Government of Buenos Aires, Argentina)**

[**QuarkID**](https://quarkid.org/) is a self-sovereign digital identity (SSI) initiative launched by the government of Buenos Aires in partnership with others. It allows citizens to securely store and reuse government-issued digital credentials using blockchain technology.

#### **How Reusability Works**

* Users receive digitally signed credentials (e.g., birth certificates, educational diplomas) from government agencies.
* These credentials are encrypted and stored in a decentralized wallet, controlled by the user.
* Citizens can reuse their credentials across different services without needing to resubmit paperwork.

#### **Implementation**

* The first phase launched in October 2023, allowing citizens to store and verify digital IDs.
* The second phase expands QuarkID to additional services, such as driver’s licenses, medical records, and social benefits.

### **BankID**&#x20;

[**BankID**](https://www.bankid.com/en/) is an electronic identity verification system used across e.g. Sweden to authenticate users and enable KYC reusability for banking, financial services, and public sector applications.

#### **How Reusability Works**

* Users verify their identity once through their bank and receive a BankID credential.
* This credential is accepted by multiple institutions, including banks, insurance companies, and government agencies.
* The trust framework behind BankID ensures that institutions can rely on their previous KYC verifications, reducing onboarding friction.

#### **Implementation**

* Over 8 million active users in Sweden alone.
* Widely accepted for banking, digital signatures, tax filings, and public services.

These case studies help demonstrate that KYC Re-usability is not a new concept, but rather evolving mechanisms grounded in international standards and national regulations. Governments and enterprises worldwide are increasingly implementing reusable identity solutions to streamline compliance, reduce friction, and enhance security. idOS aims to build upon these best practices, leveraging decentralized technology to enhance KYC Re-usability in a secure and compliant way.&#x20;
