# Example use cases

While idOS is a completely generalized system for storage and secure sharing of user data, we've outlined a few specific flows to help explain how different integrations in the stablecoin/crypto fintech space will look, pursuant to our initial market focus on self-custodial, reusable KYC.&#x20;

## Neobank & Wallet Integration

This guide outlines how digital wallets and neobanks can seamlessly integrate idOS into their platforms, enhancing user identity management and financial compliance capabilities. For wallet integrations, idOS components like the idOS Enclave can be directly embedded, enabling secure credential encryption, wallet-based account creation, and in-wallet identity management functionalities. Neobanks benefit from integrating idOS through hosted user interfaces (idOS Isle) or via SDKs, streamlining secure cross-chain identity passporting and providing end-users with full control over their identity data, access grants, and permissions directly from within their existing applications.

## Financial Module Integration

The Financial Module Integration use case describes how financial service providers (such as self-custodial banking, debit card providers, or investment platforms) can directly integrate with the idOS network. This integration allows providers to securely access existing user credentials, request and verify new credentials from identity issuers, and meet compliance obligations seamlessly. By leveraging idOS’s standardized identity workflows and encryption protocols, providers reduce the complexity of user onboarding, significantly enhance privacy, and improve the overall customer experience, while reducing compliance risks.

## TradFi→ onchain Integration

This integration scenario focuses on TradFi platforms (traditional financial institutions, fintechs, and centralized exchanges) looking to offer seamless onboarding and interoperability with Web3 ecosystems. By embedding the idOS directly into their existing infrastructures, these providers empower their users to securely migrate identity credentials and compliance data to Web3 applications and blockchain environments. This integration supports monetization opportunities through identity-based gating, allowing businesses to offer premium services based on verified credentials securely moved onto decentralized networks.
