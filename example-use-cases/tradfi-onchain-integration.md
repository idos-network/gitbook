# TradFi → onchain integration

### Overview

TradFi platforms such as fintech apps and traditional financial institutions can seamlessly transition identity management to the decentralized Web3 environment through idOS. Integrating idOS enables centralized applications to securely manage user identity data in a decentralized, encrypted, and user-controlled manner.

### How Integration Works

TradFi platforms embed the idOS into their existing infrastructure, allowing secure and compliant migration of KYC data and credentials onto decentralized identity storage. Users retain control through cryptographic keys, while platforms benefit from transparent, privacy-preserving data interactions.

### Key Benefits

* **Secure Identity Data Management:** Decentralized, encrypted credential storage with user-managed keys.
* **Compliance:** Simplifies regulatory compliance through transparent, verifiable credential management.
* **Easy Onboarding to Web3:** Enables frictionless transition for users from centralized services into decentralized applications.
